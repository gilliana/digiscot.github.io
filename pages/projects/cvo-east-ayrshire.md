## TrasmIT

### Project description

58% of Scottish Charities don't have the digital skills they need within their organisation.  

We want to help lower that number within East Ayshire for charities and other community organisations, using our trained volunteers to offer training and support to increase their online presence to widen their audience and increase participation in their activities and services. 


## Project milestones

### Phase 1 April 2015

With the purchase of our equipment and the support of Lewis, our new Informations Systems Assistant we've got a set up ready to deliver training and Lewis is working on writing some training materials that we'll use to train our trainers who will initially be volunteers from our seniors hub group.

### Phase 2 May 2015

Lewis now has seven workbooks ready to go.  We're going to be uploading these to be shared with any of the other projects who would like to use them

### Phase 3 June 2015 onwards

Ten courses to be delivered of 8 hours (6-10 participants on each course)

Ongoing support to be arranged on an individual basis

Evaluation report to be compiled. Evaluations to show that participants report increased confidence in their ability to promote their organisations online. 

Our first train the trainers session!
Photos will follow shortly.
